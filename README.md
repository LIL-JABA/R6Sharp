# R6Sharp [![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FSergeantSerk%2FR6Sharp.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FSergeantSerk%2FR6Sharp?ref=badge_shield)
## Description
An (unofficial) API wrapper for Rainbow 6 Siege to get player stats from Ubisoft's website. Although Ubisoft does not provide an official API endpoint for developers to retrieve player data (therefore not explicitly sanctioned), their own pages retrieve it through web requests using JavaScript to specific endpoints.

## Credits
Wrapper powered by Ubisoft Entertainment. All data belongs to Ubisoft and should be attributed to them unless notified otherwise by Ubisoft.
